# Hannibal
 
Hannibal is a tool that exploits insecure deserialization in Apache Commons Collection by using Transformers and Blind approach. Hence, the tool can make exploitation while verifying whether the exploit worked or not.

The tool is a java application (Jar File). Hence, it can run on Windows or Linux.
The tool also provides encoding the payload with base64 or sending raw data.
Once run, the tool prompts the user to enter the target URL in a particular format. It will reject wrong entry. The URL can be changed later using Hannibal option 6.
